      <h2>What is the Objective?</h2>
      <p>
        &emsp; The objective of this project is to create a computer device using an arduino and other electronic components. These will need to be programmed using C++ in order for the components to work together to make a device.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp; I decided to use push buttons along with an LCD 16x2 to make a small true or false game. There will be multiple questions related to what we have done throughout this computer engineering course.

            &emsp; Terence Nguyen is the project manager of this work of art. He claims he did 99.9% of the work as he is responsible for managing the video recordings, employees and deadlines. He thinks that without him, this project would've never been completed within the alotted time.

          <p>
            &emsp; Ecneret Neyugn is the circuit designer, responsible for the virtual design and physical build of the circuit. He thinks that he did majority of the work, as this project is based around the software and hardware component of how an arduino works. Words from Ecneret, "The others may say they did more work, but in reality this project is all about the arduino. Therefore, I was the one who did majority" (Neyugn).

            &emsp; Etercne Gnyune is the website designer and is in charge of making sure the website looks professional and appealing. Not only that, but he is also properly formatting his code with documentation! He has also focused on making the website easy to navigate. Finally, here is a quote from the man himself, "This website looks fabulous due to my expertise in website design! None shall top me!" (Gnyune).

      <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
      <p>
        &emsp; First of all, this project is pretty simple. I decided to do true or false because I was able to get the LCD working. Another reason was because I was planning on using a keypad to make a math game, but I felt that it was too ambitious for the time I had, especially after the python text game I made. What could I have done better? Here's a list for what I think I could've done.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Randomized questions</li>
        <li>More features ie. LEDs and/or buzzers indicating right or wrong</li>
        <li>The ability to select an amount of questions</li>
      </ul>
