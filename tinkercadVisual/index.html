      <p>
        &emsp; This is a true or false game which is controlled via 3 push buttons and the outputs will be displayed on an LCD. On setup, the game will tell you that it is a true or false game and will give you instructions to press the last button, that being the rightmost button. If any other button is pressed, there will be no output. Once the rightmost button has been pressed, the game wil start and the first question will appear on the LCD. The question will stay on the LCD until the player has pressed either the leftmost button, true, or the middle button, false. After pressing one of the 2 buttons, the LCD will then display if they are correct or wrong, then the next question will automatically appear after a short delay. This process then repeats for 5 questions. After those 5 questions, the LCD will display if the player had more or less right than wrong and then will show the amount they had right or wrong. The game will then end once the LCD displays "GOODBYE!". To play the game again, you would need to press the reset button on the arduino.
